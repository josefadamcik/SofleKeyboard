# Keebio-Parts.pretty
Various KiCAD footprints for mechanical keyboard parts. Accuracy of the footprints are not guaranteed, but a best effort has been made.

For the component symbols of some of these parts, see https://github.com/keebio/keebio-components.

## Miscellaneous Notes

### Zig-zag header holes for Pro Micro/Elite-C
The staggered header holes only work okay for connecting a controller to the PCB, so soldering is still recommended when using these footprints. But the benefit of using them is that the pins will be held straight on their own while trying to solder them on, so they are preferred over the normal footprint in that respect.

### Choc stab cutout outlines
The stab PCB/plate cutouts for Choc switches are still experimental, so use them at your own risk. The cutouts are based on measurements done on an MSI Vigor GK50 keyboard, with adjustments to handle available Kailh Choc keycaps. The stab offset difference between the GK50 keycaps and Kailh ones is 1mm.
